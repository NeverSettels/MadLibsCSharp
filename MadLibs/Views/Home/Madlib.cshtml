<h1>Hello From Afar</h1>
<p>Dear @Model.Noun1,</p>
<p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in Iceland while I learn programming! </p>
<p>@Model.Noun2, you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead.</p>
<p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
<p>Looking forward to  @Model.Verb2 you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>@Model.Verb1 Enthusiast </p>
